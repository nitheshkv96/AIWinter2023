# AI Winter 2023

Hello!!

These are some of the projects I developed and executed as part of Academic course work winter 2022

1. ANN Image Classification: Developed an Artificail Neural Network based Image Classifier that classifies the MNIST dataset. No libraries are used and all the Class methods such as forward and backward propagation, loss computation, model training, model evaluation, cross validation and gradient descent are implemented from scratch
2. Polynomial Regression: Developed a Polynomial Regression model with Ridge Regularization. No libraries are used and all the Class methods such as data cleaning, input data transformation, data scaling, loss computation, model training, model evaluation, cross validation and gradient descent are implemented from scratch
3. Recommendation system: Implemented neural network based Explicit and Implicit Recommendation system for item recommendation with custom lossfunction, Triplet loss
4. Text Parser NLP: Developed a source code that parsers through large data, cleans the data and creates vocabulary list with document frequency for all the words in the vocabulary
5. Topic Modeling and Text Summarization: Developed a probabilistic language model using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Page Rank algorithms for topic modeling and text summarization respectively.
6. Vision Transformer: Based on Transformer Encoder Architecture for NLP application, Developed a Vision Transfomer for compouter vision application specifically for image classification 


Tools Used: Spyder, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
ML Frameworks: Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Natural Language Toolkit, Spacy, Gensim
